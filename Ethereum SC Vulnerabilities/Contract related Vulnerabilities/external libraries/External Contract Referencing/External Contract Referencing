Sample code: code12a shows Inst address which isnot public or constant, so deployer of the contract could give an address in the constructor that points to another contract:
import"A.sol";
contract ExtContract{
A inst;
 constructor(A _inst){
        inst = _inst;
}
function B(string x){
// potentially do some operations here
        inst.extrFun (x);
}
