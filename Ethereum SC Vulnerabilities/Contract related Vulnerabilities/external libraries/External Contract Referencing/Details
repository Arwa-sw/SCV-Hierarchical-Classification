Describe: interacting with or referencing to external contracts via external message calls, which can mask malicious actors’ intentions in some nonobvious ways.
It will be worse If a conditional statement (if, for, while) depend on external call, that if the callee fails  (throw or revert) the caller will be prevented from completion the execution.  
Sample code: code12a shows Inst address which isnot public or constant, so deployer of the contract could give an address in the constructor that points to another contract:

Its danger: Re-Entrancy Honey Pot. The attecker can replace the expected target contract with a malicious contract.
Solution: use the new keyword and hard code any external contract addresses if they are known.
Tools can detect:  none
