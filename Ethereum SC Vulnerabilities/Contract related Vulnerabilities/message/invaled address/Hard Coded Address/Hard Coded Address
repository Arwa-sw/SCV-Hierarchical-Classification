Sample code: In the example Code28a the function transfer has two argument addr and tokens,
  if we wnt to transfer 1000 tokens to address 0xab0but by mistake we write the value of addr is 0xab which will be added 0 by EVM auto , the encoding will be ab0010000 instead of ab0001000, which leads to an increase in the transfer tokens.
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract invalidAddExp {
function hardAddr () {address owner=0xdGâ€¦C3AdlD;}
function transfer are (address addr, uint tokens) {public returns (bool succ)}
}
