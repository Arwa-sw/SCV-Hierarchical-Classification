# hard coded addresses:
 Since we cannot modify smart contracts after deploying them, hard coded addresses can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Its danger:
 Leaking Ether to arbitrary address (multi-player game) , Freezing Ether (Parity multi signature wallet attack) [1)if the addres of the mothed invoked on not contract, call return without error(if mistype the address, the ether will lost), 2)if the address is of contract and the function signature exactly match the function in the target contract, the function will invoke successfully, 3)if the address is of contract, but there is a typo in required function name, the function fallback() will invoke]

## Solution: 
can be mitigated by the developer adapting proper authorization logic in code to ensure that only the intended recipients are able to withdraw Ether
Throw if msg.data has invalid size/

Exchanges must perform input validation
Never outsource critical function to other contracts
Check the address before transferring 
Assure the correctness of the recipient address/ Use the withdraw pattern
Removing the hard coded addresses and inputting the addresses as function parameters.

## Tools can detect:
  Slither/ Securify
