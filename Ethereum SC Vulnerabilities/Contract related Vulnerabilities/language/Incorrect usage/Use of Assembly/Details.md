# Incorrect usage (Use of Assembly)

## Describe: 
Assembly is a low level language used inside solidity. It is closer to the EVM, which can interact directly with the EVM using opcodes and reduce gas 
consumption. In solidity, it can implement two types of assembly language: inline, which uses inside source code, and standalone, which can be used without solidity.
 when the code gets low-level access to the EVM, it means discarding multiple important safety features that Solidity relies on.


## Its danger:

## Tools can detect:
