# Unmatched Type (Type Casts or Types conversion)

## Describe: 
Typecasting (conversion between different data types) is a common technique in the programming languages. However, this should be used with 
caution with smart contracts as unintended and irreversible consequences can arise and it may cause to lose the data when converting representations.  

## Its danger: 
FirePonzi/King of the Ether Throne and GovernMental

## Solution: 

Explicitly declaring data types is recommended to avoid unexpected 
behaviors and/or errors.
VeriSolid can be used to build and deploy smart contracts that are free 
from this vulnerability in Solidity./To prevent typecasting to malicious contracts, the new keyword can be used. This way an instance of the 
referenced contract cannot be changed without modifying the contract as this is created at deployment time. Another technique is to hard code any 
external contract address in the contract to avoid malicious contracts 
getting referenced.   

## Tools can detect:
 Securify, Mythril
