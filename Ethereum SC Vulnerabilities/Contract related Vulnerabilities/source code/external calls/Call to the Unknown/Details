External call (Untrusted Call (Call to the Unknown))
Describe: This vulnerability arises when a recipient fallback function is invoked because the called function does not exist or transfers ether to another smart contract. and may cause harm under certain conditions.
Its danger: The DAO Attack, Known risks: Ether stealing/DoS with unexpected revert
Solution: Forcing libraries to be stateless mitigates attacks whereby attackers modify the state of the library directly to affect the contracts that depend on the libraryâ€™s code. Therefore, when using call, DelegateCall, the call-to-the-unknown attack that may change the state of the victim contract can be prevented by building stateless libraries.  
Tools can detect: Oyente, Remix, SmartCheck, Gasper, Mythril
