Sample code: in the code below, by default function withdraw() set to public access, thus any address can call it to steal the money from contract  
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract VisibilityExp {
   function withdraw() {   
 require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
     }
}
