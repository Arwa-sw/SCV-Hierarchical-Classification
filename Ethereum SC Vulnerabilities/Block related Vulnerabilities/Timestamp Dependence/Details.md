# Timestamp Dependence
**which loads to a time constraint:**
  ## Describe:
 It happens when the developer uses the block-timestamp or its alias now either 
 directly or indirectly to trigger conditions or as a source of randomness 
 generator which can be manipulated by miners. In Ethereum, the only rule about 
 timestamps is that they must be greater than the previous. In the code_a code, we 
 can see that the miners can manipulate "now" to always win and gain money. Also, 
 in the code_b, the developer uses the timestamp variable to generate a random number.

## Its danger:
 It can be misused by miners to manipulate the timestamp to gain unfair output 
 benefits (e.g., transferring the money to themselves). The GovernMental and the Run 
 are real world smart contracts that are 
 attacked using this vulnerability.
## Solution:
 The timestamp itself is not dangerous, but using it for critical operations such as 
 executing a financial transaction is. Thus, the most useful advice to avoid this 
 vulnerability is to be aware of using it in a condition check of critical 
 operations and avoid using it as the random seed. The commitment scheme is also 
 helpful in this case.
Tools can detect it: Most of the analysis tools (Oyente, Remix, SmartCheck, Mythril, 
Ethir, Slither, ContractFuzzer, and Zeus) can detect this vulnerability. Regardless 
of the different ways of analyzing the smart contract in the analysis tools, they 
detect this vulnerability by looking for the timestamp variable used within critical 
operations such as the send function.
